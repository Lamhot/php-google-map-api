#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation
==Changes from 2.5==
  * Updated to use Google Maps API v3
    * Update Polyline handling with new API v3 methods.
      * A new paramter ($id) was added in both of the polyline "add" methods.
      * Please make sure to update your apps that are using the add methods (more specifically the variable order).
      * This change was necessary to make polyline handling a bit more advanced.  
    * Removed references and everything dealing with Google Maps API key since keys are no longer necessary in V3 of the API!
    * Removed tabs support for now (not part of V3 API)
      * Potential to reincorporate with jQuery UI tabs?
    * Updated map type names to be compatible with V3 api.
    * Updated icon/marker creation to use new methods/workflows.
    * Update geocaching to use new Google Maps V3 geocoder.
      * Updated to use JSON encoding vs. csv
      * New API no longer requires API key - http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/
    * Updated automatic zoom fitting to use new map.fitBounds() API method.
    * Updated order/rendering of javascript to coincide with the latest methods using options instead of multiple calls.
  * Modified directions support (changed to directions "object" to allow instantiation of a map with directions parameters passed).  Adding get directions to an infowindow should be fairly simply using the supplied methods.   
  * Modified custom icon support, replaced "addMarkerIcon" with addIcon and updateMarkerIconKey
    * Icons will now be explicitly defined when creating a marker using the icon (and shadow) file locations
    * You can also set a default icon file to use by setting $this->default_icon (and default_icon_shadow)
    * TODO:Add more support for creating custom markers (will wait and see what people think)
      * In order to pass all values for an icon instead of just the filename,you would have too call addIcon manually and pass the x parameters.  Then when you create the markers, you can simply pass the filename and the icon will already have been initialized with the custom vs. calculated values. 
  * Added walking and biking directions support
  * Added JSMin minification support.  Note- this means that in order to leave {{{$_minify_js}}} set to true (default), you must include JSMin.php as well.  I have included a copy of this library in the repository.
